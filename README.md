# The Mini Buoy App
The Mini Buoy measures hydrodynamics at the coast. Analysis of Mini Buoy data can be done within this App for a single deployment, or for comparing reference (e.g., established vegetation) vs target (e.g. planned restoration site) locations. There are three Mini Buoy designs to choose from; the B4, B4+ and Pendant.

Mini Buoys will calculate inundation duration, current velocity, and wave orbital velocity (B4+ only) along shallow intertidal areas. Hydrodynamics are calculated from acceleration (tilt) data, gathered by acceleration loggers housed inside bottom mounted floats.

Guidance on how to assemble, deploy, and analyse Mini Buoy data is available in the handbook here.
